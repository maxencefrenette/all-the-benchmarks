# Adding shadcn/ui components

Use the shadcn/ui CLI to scaffold new components. Run `pnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest add <component>`.

# Adding benchmarks

To add a new benchmark to the leaderboard:

- Create a YAML file under `public/data/benchmarks/` containing the benchmark name, description and a `results` mapping.
- Create a scraping script under `scripts/` that generates the benchmark YAML and
  add a corresponding npm script in `package.json`.

# Model YAML files

Model definitions live in `public/data/models`. Each file includes `model`, `provider`, and optional `aliases`.

To add a new model to the leaderboard:

- Search the web for release notes or documentation to learn the official version names and differences between variants of the model. Capture all known names.
- Create a new YAML file in `public/data/models/` containing the `model` name and `provider`.
- Look at the benchmark YAML files `results` keys to find all the aliases for the model.
- Add every variant or version string as an entry under `aliases`.

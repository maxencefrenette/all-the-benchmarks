# All the Benchmarks

This project aggregates scores from popular large language model benchmarks into a single leaderboard.

The goal is to provide a clear comparison of how leading models perform across different tasks. Benchmark results are scraped from official leaderboards, transformed using a joint sigmoid model, and averaged so that each benchmark contributes equally to the overall ranking.

Visit the [About page](https://all-the-benchmarks.vercel.app/about) for more details on the methodology.

## Development

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) for dependency management. To work on the
project locally:

```bash
pnpm install       # install dependencies
pnpm dev           # start the development server
pnpm lint          # run ESLint with autofix
pnpm prettier      # format code
pnpm test          # run tests
```

For details on how benchmark data is scraped and processed, see the guidance in
[data/AGENTS.md](data/AGENTS.md).

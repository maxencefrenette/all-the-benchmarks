# All the Benchmarks

This project aggregates scores from popular large language model benchmarks into a single leaderboard.

The goal is to provide a clear comparison of how leading models perform across different tasks. Benchmark results are scraped from official leaderboards, normalized, and averaged so that each benchmark contributes equally to the overall ranking.

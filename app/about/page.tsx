            The purpose of this leaderboard is not to crown the best language
            model for a specific task. Instead it aggregates results from
            popular benchmarks so you can quickly see which lab is currently
            ahead across the evaluations that the community follows.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section className="space-y-2">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Methodology</h2>
          <p>
            Models are evaluated using a collection of public benchmarks. Raw
            scores are scraped from official leaderboards and documentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            For each benchmark we determine the minimum and maximum score across
            all models. Individual scores are normalised using minâ€“max
            normalisation and then averaged to produce the leaderboard ranking.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach ensures that benchmarks with different scales
            contribute equally to the final average.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some benchmarks also publish pricing information for completing a
            single task. When available, these values are used to compute a{" "}
            <em>Cost Per Task</em> metric shown on the leaderboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Costs are normalised separately from accuracy scores. Only models
            with prices reported for all cost-enabled benchmarks are considered
            when calculating normalisation factors. For each benchmark the
            average cost across this intersection is inverted and applied as a
            scaling factor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each model&rsquo;s cost per task figure is then the mean of its
            normalised costs across the available benchmarks, allowing fair
            comparison across tasks with different price scales.

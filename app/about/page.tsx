          <p>
            The purpose of this leaderboard is not to crown the best language
            model for a specific task. Instead it aggregates results from
            popular benchmarks so you can quickly see which lab is currently
            ahead across the evaluations that the community follows.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Methodology</h2>
          <p>
            Models are evaluated using a collection of public benchmarks. Raw
            scores are scraped from official leaderboards and documentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            For each benchmark we determine the minimum and maximum score across
            all models. Individual scores are normalised using min–max
            normalisation and then averaged to produce the leaderboard ranking.
          </p>
          <pre className="font-mono text-sm bg-muted p-4 rounded">
            normalized<sub>i,j</sub> = (score<sub>i,j</sub> − min<sub>j</sub>) /
            (max<sub>j</sub> − min<sub>j</sub>){"\n"}average<sub>i</sub> = (1 /
            B)∑<sub>j</sub> normalized<sub>i,j</sub>× 100
          </pre>
          <p>
            This approach ensures that benchmarks with different scales
            contribute equally to the final average.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some benchmarks also publish pricing information for completing a
            single task. When available, these values are used to compute a{" "}
            <em>Cost Per Task</em> metric shown on the leaderboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Costs are normalised separately from accuracy scores. A matrix of
            available price data is decomposed using a rank‑1 singular value
            decomposition (SVD) solved with alternating least squares. The
            inverse of the resulting benchmark coefficients gives a
            normalisation factor for each benchmark.
          </p>
          <pre className="font-mono text-sm bg-muted p-4 rounded">
            C ≈ u vᵀ
            {"\n"}factor<sub>j</sub> = 1 / u<sub>j</sub>
            {"\n"}cost′<sub>i,j</sub> = cost<sub>i,j</sub> × factor<sub>j</sub>
            {"\n"}CPT<sub>i</sub> = (1 / B)∑<sub>j</sub> cost′<sub>i,j</sub>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Each model&rsquo;s cost per task figure is then the mean of its
            normalised costs across the available benchmarks, allowing fair
            comparison across tasks with different price scales.
